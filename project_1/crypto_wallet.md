## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

An example of the data stored is 

| Date | Description | Category | Amount  |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sep 23 2022 | bought a house | Expenses | 10 BTC |
| Sep 24 2022 | food for house celebration | Food | 0.000001 BTC |

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a digital ledger for a client who is local trader. The digital ledger will be about keeping track of cryptocurrency transactions and is constructed using the software Python. It will take one week to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria listed bellow.

### Justifying the softwer selected
I will be using python because it is easy to learn and use, codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages. Furthermore, Python is one of the most user-friendly programming languages since it has a simple syntax and is not overly complex, putting more of an emphasis on natural language.

### Justifying the structure of the proposal solution
I'll create a Python project in Pycharm using a First Screen python file to implement the digital ledger. Several functions that have already been defined in my library Python file will be called by this file. Programming is made simpler to manage and adjust when various functions are written individually. As a result, code will be simpler to read and more approachable.

## What is LiteCoin?

Litecoin is a cryptocurrency founded in 2011, two years after Bitcoin, by a former Google engineer named Charlie Lee.
It shares similar features with Bitcoin but has a different algorithm. The cryptocurrency's goal is to become a medium for daily transactions.
Litecoin has a faster transaction processing time compared to Bitcoin.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger allows user to enter just if the password is corect. 
5. The electronic ledger display 10 biggest transactions.
6. The electronic ledger show transactions of last month.
